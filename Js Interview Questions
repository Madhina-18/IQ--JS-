The Event Loop is a system in Node.js that helps JavaScript run tasks without waiting. 
It allows JavaScript to do multiple things at the same time (asynchronous). 

How it works (Very Simple): 

JavaScript runs one line at a time (single thread). 

If a slow task comes (like API call, setTimeout), it is given to the Event Loop. 

The Event Loop waits for the task to finish in the background. 

When the task is done, the Event Loop brings the result back to JavaScript. 

Super Simple Explanation: 

👉 Event Loop = "I will wait for slow tasks. You continue your work, I’ll tell you when it’s done.

Normally we pass data from parent → child → grandchild using props, which is difficult. 
Context API removes this problem and lets us share data directly anywhere in the app. 

Super Simple Example: 

Without Context → You pass the data step-by-step (props drilling). 

With Context → You give the data in one place → all components can use it. 

One-line answer: 

Context API is used to avoid props drilling and share data easily across components. 

IL IN API: 

How to Make an API Call in React ? 

Step-by-step (Very Simple): 

Create a state → to store the API data. 

Use useEffect() → so API will call one time when page loads. 

Use fetch() or axios → to get the data from the API. 

Save the data inside the state. 

Show the data in the UI. 

 

 Example: API Call Using fetch() 

import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react"; 
 
function App() { 
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]); 
 
  useEffect(() => { 
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users") 
      .then((res) => res.json()) 
      .then((data) => setUsers(data)) 
      .catch((err) => console.log(err)); 
  }, []); 
 
  return ( 
    <div> 
      <h2>Users List</h2> 
      {users.map((user) => ( 
        <p key={user.id}>{user.name}</p> 
      ))} 
    </div> 
  ); 
} 
 
export default App; 
 

Simple Meaning: 

useEffect() → API call happens one time when page opens. 

fetch() → calls the API. 

setUsers() → stores the data. 

map() → displays the data.
